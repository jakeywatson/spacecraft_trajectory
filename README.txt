Spacecraft Trajectory Optimisation
2018
Jake Watson

Spacecraft trajectory optimisation is the problem of determining the
trajectory of a spacecraft that satisfies path constraints, such
as the duration, while minimizing a certain performance index.

 The objective of this work was to implement a basic trajectory
 optimiser for high-thrust spacecraft, travelling between Earth and Mars.
